"""The precomputed SMLA metadata: one record set per geometry, built by the port, read per layer.

``AscV41SparseAttention.Config`` -- the config that owns the fused core -- builds its own
geometry's AI_CPU metadata operators' outputs at the metadata seam, off the per-layer hot path
(the forward, the full-AC recompute and the backward alike).  The entry *is* one geometry: the
port keys itself by ``(class, compress_ratio)``, so the map carries one record set per ratio the
stack runs, no builder has to know the stack's ratio table, and every layer reads a grid built
for its own kernels.  These tests pin the contracts that make the reuse safe: what one geometry
precomputes, that the map builds each geometry exactly once, that the records are the only source
of the kernels' metadata (a row that never went through the port fails instead of falling back to
an inline operator call), the pytree shape the compiled path flattens, and the CP half rebuilding
the records from this rank's own frames.
