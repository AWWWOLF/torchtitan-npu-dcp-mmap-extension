"""Backport of upstream's decoder-owned input and attention-metadata seam.

Two upstream changes are carried here, both onto the pinned 0.3.0 decoder:

- **#4897** — attention metadata is owned by the attention backends:
  ``Decoder._get_attention_metadata`` builds one entry per distinct backend
  key, and ``Decoder.forward`` hands every layer the entry its own attention
  names.  The map is built once per microbatch, so a stack whose backends
  precompute kernel metadata (the DeepSeek stacks' CANN ``*_metadata``
  operators) pays for it once, not once per layer.
- **#4116** — the model owns the preprocessing seam:
  ``Decoder.preprocess_inputs`` turns the dataloader's ``input_dict`` into the
  forward's ``(inputs, labels, extra_kwargs)``, including the CP shard and the
  SPMD annotation.  It is the upstream home for what this repository carried
  as the model-level ``build_attention_masks`` hook, and it is what makes the
  trainer's and the validator's duplicated post-dataloading logic unnecessary
  (upstream 0.3.0 asks for exactly that dedup in a TODO).
- **#4617**, the CP half of that seam — the model owns the rank-local
  attention-metadata transform as well: ``Decoder._cp_shard`` is the upstream
  landing site, and the transform lives there instead of in the CP patch.  The
  map's entries carry this rank's frames and the kernel records built from
  them, so they are prepared after the shard, on this rank's rows.  0.3.0 has
  neither ``ParallelismContext`` nor ``shard_tensors``, so the shard inside
  ``_cp_shard`` is the pinned ``prepare_context_parallel_input`` entry point.

0.3.0 adaptation, because the pinned version predates #4116/#4617:
``labels`` is passed separately (0.3.0 keeps it out of ``input_dict``), and
``parallel_dims``/``device``/``parallelism`` stand in for #4116's
``parallelism_context`` (0.3.0 has no ``ParallelismContext``).  The
``build_attention_masks`` branch is transitional: it is the pre-#4116 shape of
the same seam, and disappears with the DeepSeek models' migration onto
``build_attention_metadata``.
