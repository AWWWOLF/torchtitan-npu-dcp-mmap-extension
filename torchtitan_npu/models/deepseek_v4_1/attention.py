"""CSA2 attention for DeepSeek V4.1.

Shape legend for this file:
    B = batch, L = sequence length, D = model dimension,
    H = ``n_heads``, Dk = ``head_dim``, rd = ``rope_head_dim``,
    N = number of compressed KV entries, K = ``index_topk``.

Each query attends to two sources at once, combined into a single masked softmax by
Attention Gym's ``gather_attn``: its own sliding window over the layer's KV
``[B, L, Dk]``, and the ``K`` compressed entries selected by the indexer out of the
shared compressed KV ``[B, N, Dk]``.  A learned per-head sink logit takes part in the
softmax denominator without contributing a value, so a row with no reachable entry
still produces zeros instead of NaN.

Packed documents reach the operator as the row's packed offsets, read off the metadata's
frames: ``cu_seqlens`` keeps a query's sliding window inside its own document and
``cu_seqlens_k`` numbers the sparse pool per document.  The selection is already in that
numbering -- the indexer emits it document-local, which is also what the fused kernels
read -- so nothing is translated here.  ``positions`` is a per-forward argument, not
metadata, and only drives RoPE.

The indexer's teacher belongs to a port, not to this core.  It is the operator's per-head
log-sum-exp of the full softmax (window, selected compressed entries and sink), turned
into the raw marginal mass ``p`` and emitted on ``topk_scores``' gradient, which the
indexer's SLIKG backward consumes to train the indexer.  A query row with no reachable
compressed entry contributes nothing.  Nothing in this file holds a loss.

The projections use the rope module with the site's un-rotated prefix width.
The reference forward owns Attention Gym attention; fused ports replace the complete
inner-attention forward.

    The whole core is Attention Gym's ``gather_attn`` in one call: ``q`` carries
    ``H`` heads while both KV sources carry a single shared head, and ``topk_indices``
    index the compressed KV -- inside each document's own entries -- with ``-1`` for unused
    slots.  ``compress_ratio`` carries the layer's verified ratio (0 window-only, 1 a
    full-resolution second KV stream, 2 the compressed shared KV): it is the grid the
    sparse pool is addressed on -- a fused port also needs it to translate the metadata's
    document boundaries into its kernel layout -- so it is never guessed from shapes.

    A port that can produce the indexer's teacher replaces this forward wholesale and
    emits it on ``topk_scores``' gradient; this core has no kernel to make one.  Which port
    is in place is read off the requested overrides, one stage earlier, by
